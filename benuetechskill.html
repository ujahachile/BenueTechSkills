            <h4>Benue Tech Skill is the brain child of the unmatchable working governor of Benue state; His Excellency, Rev Fr. Hyacinth Iormem Alia who is a lover of the youth and all that concerns them.</h4> 
            <h4>The programme is aimed at building capacity in the area of information Technology which is the blood powering the world now after God</h4>
            <h4>At the end of this capacity building, benue youths who are serious with their lives and destinies will have something to hold on to on the palms of their hands to be thankfull for.</h4>
            <h4>Whether it is pure IT, marketing, advertisement, education, the programme covered all, cos the skill learnt has the potential to develop them all</h4>
            <h4>My sincere prayer is that God will lead the state government and the facilitators of the programme to a successful end</h4>
